# team-profile-generator

For this project, I have created a team profile generator. Based on the input submitted by the user, using Node and Jest, it will create an html page with the information in employee cards.

#installation
Please clone the repo and have Node and Jest downloaded to your machine to install the packages required. In the terminal, use "node index" to start inputting the information.
